<h1 style="color: rgb(0,139,139);"> Personal Information</h1>
<p>I have worked in a few industries, covering industries such as telecommunications, child care, financial and mortgage broking and across different levels of management. 

<p>I have extensive administration and management skill set but have been wanting to look at the area of IT due to my interest in technology.

<p>I believe in being a life long learner and have continued to study over the years.

<p>Interesting fact: One of my all-time favourite sports is pool (8-ball) and snooker. In my early 20s, I represented Australia in the 8-ball & 9-ball competition in Las Vegas. I have loved the sport ever since.</p>

<h1 style="color: rgb(0,139,139);">Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have loved IT for a very long time – ever since my uncle showed me the first Apple Mac computer with a floppy disc. He was part of an Apple club and would tell me all about it. The interest and love for new technology has always been there. My uncle seems to be able to fix anything, even though he never formally worked in the field. This has inspired me to move to a job that will love rather than working with what I know and not really enjoying work. </p>

<p>I love to help people trouble shoot their computer and network problems. I find myself getting excited about infrastructure of a how a network comes together – even though I know nothing about the network just basic household knowledge but would love to know more. 
</p>

<p>I chose RMIT because of the introduction subject, I felt would give me a vast overview of the many facets of IT and I will know after this subject whether I should pursue a career in IT or is this a passing phase. </p>

<p>I hope to learn whether there is place for me, that I will enjoy the work and find my best fit in a part of IT that maybe I do not know about yet.
</p>

<h3 style="color: rgb(60,179,113);">Ideal Job</h3>
<p>It has been a difficult task to uncover what kind of job I would really like to work toward in IT because sometimes you do not know what you do not know. My limited knowledge of the IT job market has left me to only go with what I know so a far……. Therefore, after some research and trawling through the job market, as well as looking up profiles of people I know in IT and researching what is entailed in their IT roles – I discovered that I would be keen to explore the avenue of Database Administrator or Network Administrator, the management of data and information. Robert Half job website has several jobs for database and network administrators. 

<p>Robert Walters job website has jobs in Information Technology-

</p>

<p>As we move more into cloud computing I believe I would be interested in cloud infrastructure. I discover what is involved in cloud computing and infrastructure.
</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(60,179,113);">The skills required:</h2>
<p>-Degree in computer science or information technology</p>
<p>-Understanding the cloud technology – AWS, Azure, SQL, Git, Javascript</p>
<p>-Become familiar with data analytics 
</p>

<h3  style="color: rgb(60,179,113);">Learning Plan:</h3>
<p>-Complete Degree in Information Technology</p>
<p>-Develop skills set in Javascript, SQL and GIT</p>
<p>-Cloud technology fundamentals
</p>



<h1 style="color: rgb(0,139,139);">Personal Profile</h1>
<h4 style="color: rgb(60,179,113);">16 Personalities</h4>

<h1 style="color: rgb(0,139,139);">Project Idea</h1>
<p>Develop an app that collates all your financial information, linking your bank accounts, credit cards, personal and car loans, home loans – investment and owner occupied into one app. You link your information and have a full snap shot of your current financial position – income in, expenses, assets and liabilities.</p>

<p>To take it one step further, you can select the information you wish to share with you financial planner, mortgage broker, bank or lending institution for a full assessment for the ease of collating your information and providing for future lending or wealth portfolio planning. </p>

<p>It could also provide a copy of statements for all liabilities when providing access via a secure portal that links with the app.</p>

<p>This would be a user developed application that would provide a comprehensive statement of financial position for the individual or couple as well as company secure data collection when assisting a client.</p>

<p>The user would have full control and security access and could provide one time access or ongoing access to the provider of their choice. </p>

<p>The overall solution would provide a seemless approach to lending, wealth planning and retirement planning where the individual could manage themselves or seek the advise of a professional to interpret the information and help with investment strategies.</p>

<p>The user could also take a photo of receipts and other important information for tax time to provide to their accountant or just simply keep in a secure cloud server to store for the period required by the tax office of 7 years.</p>

<p>This would be full financial integration app that would also speak with the tax office portal to file transfer the information across to the ATO website for the completion of tax returns.</p>

<h3 style="color: rgb(60,179,113);">Competitor offerings:</h3>
<p>There are many apps on the market that help with budgeting and banks are now investing collecting expenses information from the transactional banking of a customer. </p>

<p>It would assist in reducing paperwork, time for both the client and the advisor in collating and give back more time for analysis and the opportunity to develop more comprehensive advice.
